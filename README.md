**What is Sutetchi?**

Sutetchi is a very early wip Minecraft mod that revoles around Slimelins, a new slime mob entity that can be tamed.

**Future plans:**

* Add Slimelin themed decor and misc items used for building/creative purposes.

**Currently Available:**

* Tame Slimelins via a Tame Crystal which can be crafted. Slimelins spawn in the Swamp Biome.

* Slimelins have basic AI, they will follow you once tamed, and can sit via right clicked on once tamed.

* You can apply outfits to your slimelin with items crafted from rare loot in dungeon chests.

**Requires Minecraft Fabric 1.19.2 and GeckoLib 1.19.2**
