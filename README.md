**The Official Repo for the Sutetchi Mod!**

**What is Sutetchi?**

Sutetchi is a very early wip Minecraft mod that revoles around Slimelins, a new slime mob entity that can be tamed.

**Future plans:**

* Add Outfit/Texture swaps for your Slimelin aquired via dungeon loot.

* Add Items found in dungeons that can increase your Slimelins base health, damage, ect

* Add Slimelin themed decor and misc items used for building/creative purposes.

**Currently Available:**

* Tame Slimelins via a Tame Crystal. Slimelins spawn in the Swamp Biome. You can craft a Tame Crystal with a poppy flower, 4 diamonds and 4 lapis lazuli.

* Slimelins have basic AI, they will follow you once tamed, and can sit via right clicked on once tamed.

Full disclosure, this mod was made as a side project to help me learn Java and just for fun, as such, the mod's repo acts as a way to share the code with friends. If you stumble upon this mod feel free to download and try it yourself, but I would personally not reccomend using it in a mod pack or anything as there's
bound to be bugs. You are, of course, free to do so, but I would advise against it.

**Requires Minecraft Fabric 1.19.2 and GeckoLib 1.19.2**
