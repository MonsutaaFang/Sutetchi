**The Official Repo for the Sutetchi Mod!**

What is Sutetchi?

Sutetchi is a Minecraft mod that revolves around Slimelins, a new slime mob that can be tamed.

Information:

* Slimelins spawn in Swamp biomes.

* Tame Slimelins with a Tame Crystal, you can craft one with four Lapis surrounding one Poppy Flower. Once tamed they will fight for you and can be commanded to sit by right clicking on.

* Decorate your Slimelin by applying various colors and outfits crafted with items found in loot chests.

* Upgrade your Slimelins base health by finding slime shards in loot chests.

This mod was made for use in my single player world, but figured id share it for the holidays. This mod is still a wip, I will continue development on it when I have spare time.

**Requires Minecraft Fabric 1.19.2 and GeckoLib 1.19.2**
